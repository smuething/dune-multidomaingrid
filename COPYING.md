* Version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
  Foundation, with the following special exception for linking and compiling
  against the MultiDomainGrid library, the so-called "runtime exception":

    As a special exception, you may use the MultiDomainGrid source files as part of
    a software library or application without restriction.  Specifically, if other
    files instantiate templates or use macros or inline functions from one or
    more of the MultiDomainGrid source files, or you compile one or more of the
    MultiDomainGrid source files and link them with other files to produce an
    executable, this does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered
    by the GNU General Public License.  This exception does not however invalidate
    any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by the GNU General
    Public License.

  This license is intended to be similar to the GNU Lesser General Public
  License, Version 2, which by itself isn't suitable for a template library. You
  can find a copy of the GNU General Public License, Version 2, in the file
  [GPL-2][3] or at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.
